									<h3>Price $4116.45</h3>
								  <p>DW's flagship line, the Collector's Series, are the original American-made custom drums. For years, drum makers have preferred maple for its resonant tonal qualities. Maple is a traditional shell material that provides low-end punch, warmth and attack. This DW Shell Pack features North American Maple shells with 3-ply reinforcement hoops. Toms 8-13" are 6-ply, while 14" and bigger are 7-ply. Bass drums are also 7-ply.</p>
