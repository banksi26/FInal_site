Price $1499.99
Overview
The road-proven combination of warmth, power and tonal purity that made Masters a legend shines on. Pearl’s innovative EvenPly 6-layer premium maple shell, 2.3mm Superhoops and an improved price tag make Masters a must for the touring pro.

Pearl’s Masters Series has always been synonymous with the best of professional instruments for the touring drummer. In creating new Masters Maple Complete drums, Pearl has crafted a refined representation of Masters’ 25-year history in one total package.

The EvenPly-Six Shells are constructed from six layers of premium North American maple which now incorporate cross-laminated plies of reduced thickness. This 28% thinner shell produces the tonal purity and increased resonance of Pearl’s legendary Masters MMX, while projecting with the vibrant power of the thicker MRX series.

Pearl’s Superior Shell Technology utilizes a proprietary technique for achieving the ultimate air chamber. It begins with select woods chosen for their unique acoustic attributes, milled to precise thickness with overlapping scarf joint seams, for a perfect air-tight fit. The wood plies are saturated with Pearl’s proprietary “AcoustiGlue” that permeates every pore and dries to the exact consistency of the wood for optimum resonance. The plies are formed in high-temperature molds with 1000 PSI of hydraulic pressure to produce perfect drum shells that exhibit superior tone, optimal resonance and extreme strength.

This set features Masters professional hardware including SP30 spurs, LB40 floor tom legs, insulated die-cast bass drum claws and sleek bridge-style CL lugs for reduced shell contact. Masters Maple Complete also features triple-flanged SuperHoop II Hoops on the tom and snares. Lastly, these drums are finished with a lacquer finish and Remo heads.
